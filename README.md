# Mac Bubb
As a kid of the 90s, my curiosity led to experimenting with computers: custom DOOM wads, websites for school projects, visual basic, pascal, C++,... I found endless delight in **making cool stuff**.

After a couple software engineer internships I pivoted to teach high school math until transitioning to stay at home dad.üë®‚Äçüçº

All the while, I've been tinkering with computers and code, and in the past 5 years taken a deep dive into web development.

I've coded sites for local businesses: 
- [Erin Norman gardens](https://erinnormangardens.com) 
- [Summit Tree Service](https://summittreepros.com).

I've worked on my own projects:
- [Running Kindness](https://runningkindness.com)
- [Madrona Web](https://madronaweb.com)
- [Gamertag Brain Tsunami](https://gamertagbraintsunami.com)

I occasionally blog on coding techniques: [2nd place rank for "responsive css hero"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=responsive+css+hero).

I continue to code and learn new technologies because I'm still enthralled by **making cool stuff**.  

I am also ready to make cool stuff with a team: contact me at bubbem@gmail.com
