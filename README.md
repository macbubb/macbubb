# Mac Bubb
As a kid, my curiosity led to experimenting with computers: custom DOOM wads, websites for school projects, visual basic, pascal, C++,... I found endless delight in **making cool stuff**. I still love to use computers to solve a problem, whether for a customer, or my own everyday needs.

I worked for years as a high school math teacher but now I am a full stack web developer. I am hooked on the satisfaction of solving problems and love to see an idea go from a pencil and paper sketch to a full blown responsive web app.
