😴 I feel like **Rip Van Winkle**. 

I've coded since the 90s and was an intern developer for a couple summers. I pivoted careers to teach high school math until transitioning to stay at home dad. 👨‍🍼

Just like Rip woke and found a new America, I've returned to coding to find a whole new world in software development. Each week I find some new tool or standard and have my mind blown. Flexbox, media queries, Browser-sync, SASS, stackexchange, git, node, react.js, ... 
I keep finding myself delighted by something super cool- that we never had back in the day: browser-sync, git, SASS, flexbox, babel, ... 😲

I've coded sites for local businesses: [Erin Norman gardens](https://erinnormangardens.com), [Summit Tree Service](https://summittreepros.com). 

I've worked on my own projects: [Running Kindness](https://runningkindness.com), [Madrona Web](https://madronaweb.com).

I occasionally blog on cool techniques I develop: [2nd place rank for "responsive css hero"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=responsive+css+hero).

I love to code and I am always developing a project. I am also ready to join a team: contact me at bubbem@gmail.com
